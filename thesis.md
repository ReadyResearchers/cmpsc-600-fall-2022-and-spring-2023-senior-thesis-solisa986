# Introduction

This chapter describes your completed senior thesis work,
including the overall aims  and the background motivating your research. Whenever
possible, you should use one or more concrete examples and technical diagrams.

It is often useful and necessary to separate the introduction into multiple sections.
Several possible sections are proposed below, you can use these or distribute your
introductory text into sections in another way.

The headings below propose _one way_ you might structure this section of the document.

## Motivation

## Current State of the Art

## Goals of the Project

## Ethical Implications

This document requires that you discuss the ethical implications of your work -- no
matter how benign you consider the outcome of your project. As several major studies
of ethical issues in computer science assert: _no project is completely value-neutral_.

To assist you in elaborating on these issues, the following areas are topics you might
consider addressing. You do not need to address all of them.

* Information Privacy
* Information Accuracy (e.g. can contain reliability)
* Potential Misuse (e.g. computer crime, unintended consequences)
* Second- or Third-Party Risk (e.g. safety)
* Data Collection Issues (e.g. issues inherent in collecting data)
* Algorithmic or Data Bias
* Potential Power Difference / Social Imbalance / Issues in Equity

In addition, reflect on ways that the above harms can be or are mitigated by your work

# Related work

This chapter includes a broad and detailed review of relevant existing work.
The literature review should provide background and context for the thesis work.
The subsections may be organized in whatever manner seems best suited to the material--
chronological, or by topic, or according to some other criteria
(e.g., primary versus secondary resources).

If ethical issues are central to this work, you should also address historical and
contemporary issues or efforts made to address them.

# Method of approach

This chapter answers the "how" question - how did you complete your project,
including the overall design of your study, details of the algorithms and tools you
have used, etc.  Use technical diagrams, equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text
to describe the research that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and
tables and to explicitly refer to them in your text.

This should contain:

* lists
* with points
* and more points
  * possibly subpoints

For those projects whose implications address social or moral issues (i.e. ethical
standards, causes, effects), you will want to use this section to describe how you
actively mitigated or considered these issues.

# Experiments

This chapter describes your experimental set up and evaluation. It should also
produce and describe the results of your study. The section titles below offer
a typical structure used for this chapter.

## Experimental Design

Especially as it pertains to responisble computing, if conducting experiments or
evaluations that involve particular ethical considerations, detail those issues here.

## Evaluation

## Threats to Validity

# Conclusion

Traditionally, this chapter addresses the areas proposed below as sections, although
not necessarily in this order or organized as offered. However, the last section --
"Ethical Implcations" is required for this chapter. See the heading below for more
details.

## Summary of Results

## Future Work

## Future Ethical Implications and Recommendations

Especially as pertains to the public release or use of your software or methods, what
unresolved or special issues remain? What recommendations might you make?

## Conclusions
