# Introduction

This chapter aims to describe the motivation, the current state of research, the overall goals, and the ethical implications that arose while preparing this project.

## Motivation

There has been a giant leap in the amount of movies being produced, especially with streaming platforms starting to create their own movies/tv shows as well. With this leap also came a drastic change in the success of movies, as the preferences and criteria for movies had changed, with respect to the consumers. With this analysis, it can be determined that the weight of past research does not necessarily continue to define what exactly makes movies and tv shows successful for the movie industry. Therefore, this paper serves to provide an analysis of the different factors that can affect movie success, with the final result being a trained model that can predict the success of a movie based on the evaluated factors. The factors that will be evaluated will be the actors, the genre, the director, the production budget, the overall revenue, and the main source of revenue (domestic, international, etc.). As streaming is the focal point of the personalization of the movie industry, we will also evaluate whether these factors comply with the movie trends on certain streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Amazon Prime.

## Current State of the Art

## Goals of the Project

## Ethical Implications

This document requires that you discuss the ethical implications of your work -- no
matter how benign you consider the outcome of your project. As several major studies
of ethical issues in computer science assert: _no project is completely value-neutral_.

To assist you in elaborating on these issues, the following areas are topics you might
consider addressing. You do not need to address all of them.

* Information Privacy
* Information Accuracy (e.g. can contain reliability)
* Potential Misuse (e.g. computer crime, unintended consequences)
* Second- or Third-Party Risk (e.g. safety)
* Data Collection Issues (e.g. issues inherent in collecting data)
* Algorithmic or Data Bias
* Potential Power Difference / Social Imbalance / Issues in Equity

In addition, reflect on ways that the above harms can be or are mitigated by your work

# Related work

This chapter includes a broad and detailed review of relevant existing work.
The literature review should provide background and context for the thesis work.
The subsections may be organized in whatever manner seems best suited to the material--
chronological, or by topic, or according to some other criteria
(e.g., primary versus secondary resources).

If ethical issues are central to this work, you should also address historical and
contemporary issues or efforts made to address them.

# Method of approach

This chapter answers the "how" question - how did you complete your project,
including the overall design of your study, details of the algorithms and tools you
have used, etc.  Use technical diagrams, equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text
to describe the research that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and
tables and to explicitly refer to them in your text.

This should contain:

* lists
* with points
* and more points
  * possibly subpoints

For those projects whose implications address social or moral issues (i.e. ethical
standards, causes, effects), you will want to use this section to describe how you
actively mitigated or considered these issues.

# Experiments

This chapter describes your experimental set up and evaluation. It should also
produce and describe the results of your study. The section titles below offer
a typical structure used for this chapter.

## Experimental Design

Especially as it pertains to responisble computing, if conducting experiments or
evaluations that involve particular ethical considerations, detail those issues here.

## Evaluation

## Threats to Validity

# Conclusion

Traditionally, this chapter addresses the areas proposed below as sections, although
not necessarily in this order or organized as offered. However, the last section --
"Ethical Implcations" is required for this chapter. See the heading below for more
details.

## Summary of Results

## Future Work

## Future Ethical Implications and Recommendations

Especially as pertains to the public release or use of your software or methods, what
unresolved or special issues remain? What recommendations might you make?

## Conclusions
