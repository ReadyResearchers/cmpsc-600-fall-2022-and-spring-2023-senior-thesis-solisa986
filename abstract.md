# Abstract

Through looking at the emerging trends in the movie industry, it is inferred that individuals are increasingly becoming interested in the multifaceted personalization of their movie choices. Most streaming platforms utilize different algorithms that keep track of userâ€™s choices to recommend movies, which further perpetuates the need for unique streaming choices. However, the research done thus far has only touched on the different factors affecting movie production, which doesn't include much reference to how these factors would also apply to movie streaming services and their comprehensive data. This knowledge gap requires one to explore different ways that streaming services and other sectors of the movie industry make a profit so that success-based movie recommendations can be made available to users. This is where the research conducted in this paper comes in, as the analysis of streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, etc.), movie production (actors, budget, directors, etc.), and overall revenue is used to determine what exactly makes a movie successful in order to build a movie recommendation system. This paper will serve as a comprehensive analysis of different determinants of movie success. These determinants will be analyzed with a Logistic Regression algorithm, where the results will then be put into a machine-learning model. Once the model is appropriately trained and tested, then the resulting application will be displayed on a [Streamlit-based web application](https://movies123forme.streamlit.app/).
