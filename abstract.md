# Abstract

By looking at the emerging trends in the entertainment industry, it can be inferred that individuals are becoming increasingly interested in the deep personalization of their movie choices. Most streaming platforms now utilize different comprehensive algorithms that keep track of user’s choices, which should further perpetuate the need for unique streaming. However, the research done in thus far has only touched on the different factors affecting movie success and not the rising demand for individualization in streaming. This knowledge gap requires one to explore different ways for streaming services and other sectors of the movie industry to tailor their services for their consumers. This is where the research done in this paper comes in, where the analysis of streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, etc.), movie production (actors, budget, directors, etc.), and overall revenue is used to determine what exactly makes a movie successful. This paper will be a comprehensive analysis of different determinants that affect movie success, such as actors, genres, production budget, movie sales, and directors. These determinants will be analyzed with a Logistic Regression algorithm, which will then be put into a machine-learning model. Once the model is appropriately trained, then the results will be displayed on a cloud-based deployment of a [Streamlit-based application](https://movies123forme.streamlit.app/).
