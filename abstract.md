# Abstract

Provide a concise summary of your proposed research of approximately 250

it a summary of the entire document. It makes sense to wait to write the abstract
until the rest of the document has been written. Write your abstract using
the `abstract.md` file, and the template will automatically include it.


By looking at the emerging trends in the entertainment industry, it can be inferred that individuals are becoming increasingly interested in the deep personalization of their movie choices. Most streaming platforms now utilize different comprehensive algorithms that keep track of userâ€™s choices, which should further perpetuate the need for unique streaming. However, the research done in thus far has only touched on the different factors affecting movie success and not the rising demand for individualization in streaming. This knowledge gap requires one to explore different ways for streaming services and other sectors of the movie industry to tailor their services for their consumers. This is where the research done in this paper comes in, where the analysis of streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, etc.), movie production (actors, budget, directors, etc.), and overall revenue is used to determine what exactly makes a movie successful.
